Support resource files for my freely available Portuguese-written music theory book at [www.teoria-musical.com](https://www.teoria-musical.com/)

Remarkable software used:

- [LilyPond](https://lilypond.org/) : used for generating the music scores
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) : used to convert audio files from AIFF to MP3
- [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/) : used for analysing and plotting the [power spectrum](https://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/pspectrum.html) of the audio signal produced by an acoustic piano (A4) and a gong
